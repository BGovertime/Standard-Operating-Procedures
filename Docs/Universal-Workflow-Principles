Universal-Workflow-Principles
1️⃣ Prioritize the tools.
VS Code→ Used as the primary IDE for development and documenting code/manuals.
GitHub→ Maintain standard repositories, version control, and workflows.
Week→ Used as living documentation for manuals and references.
Note→ Record short ideas or to-do lists using quick capture.
Docs→ Complete summaries of research papers, reports, and manuals.
Cloud (recommended)→ Store the original file and additional data (OneDrive/Google Drive)
Sources of information and social media (finally)→ Used for publishing and sharing results.

2️⃣ Steps in the process (Workflow Loop)
Analyze and create content.
Use VS Code + Note → draft and prototype.
Save and control versions.
Commit to GitHub → Use the branch for the new project.
Explain and link the information.
Update Wiki → Sub-guide + query reference
Summarize and archive.
Docs → Full Report
Cloud → Stores the original files.
Share and present.
Zoom + Email → Meetings, sending summaries, notifications
Social → Published when ready.
Loop
Every day involves summarizing and planning.
Review and update the repository every year.

3️⃣ Daily Calendar Loop
time
activity
tool
09:00 – 12:00
Analyze/write code/record ideas
VS Code, Note
12:00 – 13:00
Take a break/Review

13:00 – 15:00
Commit + Update Wiki/Docs
GitHub, Wiki, Docs
20:00 – 21:00
Daily task summary
Docs, Note
21:00 – 22:00
Plan for the next day + Zoom meeting
Email, Zoom


4️⃣ System Integration
Email + Calendar→ Automatic daily summary delivery, Zoom meeting scheduling.
Zoom→ Use the time period of 21:00–22:00 for team syncing.
GitHub Actions→ Automatically update Wiki/Docs when a commit occurs.
Cloud Sync→ Keep the original files and link them with Docs.

5️⃣ Annual work loop
every day→ Analyze → Commit → Summarize → Plan
every month→ Review repository + Wiki → Update information
Every year→ System-wide audit → Improve workflow → Start the loop again

How it works
TriggerEvery time there is a commit on a branch.mainOr press manual run.
step:
Checkout repository
Set up Git for the bot.
Copy files from docs/Go to the Wiki repository (.wiki)
Commit and push to Wiki repo.
resultThe Wiki will automatically update to match the documentation whenever there is a commit.

🌐 Key features of this template:
Reusable every year (same standard).
Real-time updates when a commit occurs.
Supports manual triggers for special syncs.
Reduce redundancy: Docs are the primary source of information, Wiki is a mirror for reference.
